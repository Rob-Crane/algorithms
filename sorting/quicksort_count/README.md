# Quicksort Count Comparisons

Demonstrates the impact of pivot selection on efficiency of quicksort.  Pivot is chosen in three ways: first element, last element, or "median of three" which is median of first, middle, and last element.  For each choice prints the number of comparisons Quicksort would be required to make.  Pass input as space separated integer list on stdin.  For example:
```
cat Quicksort10.txt | cargo run
```
