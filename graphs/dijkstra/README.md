# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Calculate the minimum cost path lengths from a source node in a directed graph.

## Usage

Graph definition is read from stdin following specification described [here](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs/tree/master/testCases/course2/assignment2Dijkstra).  An example dataset is provided here in `test.txt`.  To execute example from this directory:
```
cat test.text | cargo run
```
