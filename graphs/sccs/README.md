# Kosaraju Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components
Compute the sizes of the strongly connected components of a directed graph.  The strongly connected components of a directed graph are the maximal regions for which a path exists between every pair of nodes.

## Usage
Graph definition is read from stdin following specification described [here](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs/tree/master/testCases/course2/assignment1SCC).  An example dataset is provided here in `SCC_test.txt`.  To execute example from this directory:
```
cat SCC_test.txt | cargo run
```
